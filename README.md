**WARNING**

This browser does not run well on Windows XP SP2 and lower. If you do not want to install SP3, be ready for crashes and blue screens.
If you are on SP2 or lower, there is no need to post a screenshot from blue_screen_view. I suggest to apply the updates from POSReady 2009..

**IF YOU GOT A BLUE SCREEN**

Don't post a screenshot of the blue screen, as it is not useful for troubleshooting.


Use http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html and post on the attachment data report as in the example below.

**IF YOU GOT A CRASH BUT WITHOUT BLUE SCREEN**

Please post drwatson.log only.
