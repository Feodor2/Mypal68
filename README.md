**WARNING**

This browser does not run well on winxp SP2 and lower. If you do not want to install SP3, be ready for crashes and blue screens.
If you are on SP2 and lower, there is no need to post a screenshot from blue_screen_view. And i suggest to apply postready updates of 2019.

**IF YOU GOT A BLUE SCREEN**

Don't post a screenshot of the blue screen, as the screen isn't useful for troubleshooting.

Use http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html and post on the attachment data report as on the example below.

**IF YOU GOT A CRASH BUT WITHOUT BLUE SCREEN**

Please post drwatson.log only. Do not post any irrelevent logs.
