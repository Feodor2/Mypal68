**The most recent version is 68.13 nightly**

[Look here for download](https://github.com/Feodor2/Mypal68/issues/160)

**WARNING**

This browser does not run well on winxp SP2 and lower. If you do not want to install SP3, be ready for crashes and blue screens.
If you are on SP2 and lower, there is no need to post a screenshot from blue_screen_view. And I suggest to apply postready updates of 2019.


**IF YOU GOT A CRASH BUT WITHOUT BLUE SCREEN**

Please post drwatson.log only. It is located inside \Documents and settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Dr Watson
Do not post any irrelevant things.

**IF YOU GOT A BLUE SCREEN**

Don't post a screenshot of the blue screen, as the screen isn't useful for troubleshooting.
No anymore report needed, either you may research it or wait for a new version where it will be fixed

**YOU MAY DONATE**
