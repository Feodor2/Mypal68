**WARNING**

This browser does not run well on winxp SP2 and lower. If you do not want to install SP3, be ready for crashes and blue screens.
If you are on SP2 and lower, there is no need to post a screenshot from blue_screen_view. And i suggest to apply postready updates of 2019.
Some say that it runs fine on sp2 but there's no accurate data on 
what to do.
You can also try this on vista and later which in case of 7 is useless outside of non-sse2 computers. You'd better use 115esr when supported.

**IF YOU GOT A BLUE SCREEN**

Don't post a screenshot of the blue screen, as the screen isn't useful for troubleshooting.
For more data look [#3](https://github.com/Feodor2/Mypal68/issues/3), and please do not make new duplicate reports.
Suddenly restart may be also this error depends of the settings

**IF YOU GOT A CRASH BUT WITHOUT BLUE SCREEN**

Describe detailed how to reproduces the crash, do not forget to put the link.
Do not post pictures of the crash, this is useless and a waste.
If i don't reproduce the crash myself then you may to submit drwatson.log.
Drwatson log is usually inside All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Dr Watson.
Minidump also may be usefull. Do not post any irrelevent logs.

**IF YOU WANT REPORT A SITE**

Report [there](https://github.com/Feodor2/Mypal68/issues/228).
Put the actual link to the site
Notice that i never would look to the site which requires the login, including any goolag sites. Please try to find what feature is missig by yourself.
Then report like for site 'x' is missing feature 'y'

**YOU MAY DONATE**
