**WARNING**

This browser does not run well on SP2 and lower. If you do not want to install SP3, be ready for crashes and blue screens.
If you are on SP2 and lower, there is no need to post a screenshot from blue_screen_view.

**IF YOU GOT A BLUE SCREEN**

Don't post a screenshot of the blue screen, as the screen isn't useful for troubleshooting.

Use http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html and post a screenshot of the data from it, like the example below
