# Mypal 68
A web browser aiming to backport an older version of Mozilla's 'Quantum' engine (which powers projects such as Firefox) to older x86-based Windows systems (XP and Vista), as a stable, open-source, modern alternative to using proprietary Chromium forks or kernel-modifying extensions on these operating systems.

**Currently in beta.**

## Installation
Currently, an installer is not provided. This may change in the future to make user installs easier and more customisable, like the previous Goanna-based versions.

Simply head to the [releases directory](https://github.com/Feodor2/Mypal68/releases/tag/68.12.2b) and make sure to pick the latest version (unless you require specific functionality in an earlier build).

* Processor and amount of RAM
* Any specific configurations made to the browser
* What website(s) and/or content type were attempted to be viewed if applicable
